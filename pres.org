* Beats
** Clicking on a node in model network
** Changing the model, seeing it update
** Selecting a model with the module graph
** Questions
*** What are your thoughts on the syntax?
* Requirements
** Responsive interface
*** Update graphs
*** Interact with graphs?
* Interface Implementation
** Web tech for clickable graphs
** 1 Locally generate page from web server
** 2 Compile everything to javascript and run directly
** Graph tools
*** Alchemy http://graphalchemist.github.io/Alchemy/#/docs
    Feature rich, simple, up to date
    Seems you can enable captions by default with "nodeCaptionsOnByDefault: false" in the config, which I can't find documentation for (discussed here https://github.com/GraphAlchemist/Alchemy/issues/390)
*** Dracula graph library
    https://www.graphdracula.net/showcase/
    Javascript imperatively created but nice and simple
*** https://github.com/mountainstorm/jquery.graphviz.svg/
    Make graphviz output scrollable, zoomable, interactive
    Looks old
*** https://github.com/magjac/d3-graphviz
    Nice, up-to-date visualization but no apparent interaction
*** Ace for editing later?
    https://gist.github.com/jrnold/6a2e3b565cf78d871ca0
*** Highlight.js
    You can't edit with it, and it seems weird to have that asymmetry
** Plan
*** html hello world
*** html+javascript hello world
*** haskell sockets
*** html+javascript+sockets
*** alchemy hello world
*** graph panes
* Interface
** Left: Modular program
** Center: Model or module graph
** Right: Concrete program
* TODO
 * Figure out argument handling, whether you can inline etc (e.g. golf model)
 * At minimum, use the graphviz tool for model graphs as well, so you can highlight the selected
 * Ideally, also implement the cool highlighting like in the email
 * Directed edges with numbered tags
 * Golf demo with notes
 * Comment save?
